# ECMAScript

ECMAScript (or ES) is a trademarked scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. Well-known implementations of the language, such as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript have come into wide use for client-side scripting on the Web.
